# Evolution Simulator
I've always wanted to make an ecosystem and watch creatures adapt and evolve. Here's what I made:

## Version history
0.0.1: Initial commit

0.0.2: Nav mesh implemented

0.0.3: Creatures wander around

0.0.4: Food Introduced
- Creatures now have the need for food and will die without it
- Creatures will wander when full and search for food when hungry
